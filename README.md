# Car Tracker
This application serves as a basic front end for the Car Tracker API. This API allows for the management of car inventory and cusomers. Presently this application focuses on managing car inventory with customer functionality in the works. 

This application was created using React and create react app. Documentation for create react app is included below. 

## Application Usage
Once you navigate to the application, you will need to login by clicking the login button in the top right corner. Once authenticated you will be redirected to a view page that will show you all cars in the inventory. This page will allow you to search car inventory as well as delete cars from your inventory. 

In the nav bar you will also see a link to an add page. This page will bring you to a form that will allow you to add new cars to your inventory. After adding a car you can navigate back to the view page to see your new inventory item. 

## Application set up
If you would like to setup this application you will need to first have a configured API backend. Instructions for setting that up can be found [here](https://github.com/2011JavaReact/car-tracker). 

After configuring your backend, be sure you have node.js and npm installed. You can then start up the development server with the folowing commands:
> npm i

>npm start

This will start up the development server on the local machine. 

To deploy this application run the command
> npm run build

This will create a build directory with the static files necessary to run the application. Once you have this directory all you need to do is move the files to the web server of your choice, such as apache or ngix. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
